--- Kyra Splash Screen.

	It would be appreciate if you display the Kyra splash screen when using
	either license, however it is only required for the LGPL. All the
	resources for the splash are compiled into the library, and it can be
	accessed through the following API:

		KrEngine::StartSplash
		KrEngine::UpdateSplash
		KrEngine::EndSplash

	Full documentation is provided with the KrEngine class. The splash screen
	should be displayed for 2 seconds.

	Thank you.
