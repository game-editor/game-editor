      <p> GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
        Version 2, June 1991</p>
      <p> Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
        59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA<br>
        Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
        of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>
      <p> Preamble</p>
      <p> The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br>
        freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>
        License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free<br>
        software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This<br>
        General Public License applies to most of the Free Software<br>
        Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to<br>
        using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by<br>
        the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to<br>
        your programs, too.</p>
      <p> When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>
        price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>
        have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>
        this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it<br>
        if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it<br>
        in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.</p>
      <p> To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>
        anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.<br>
        These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you<br>
        distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.</p>
      <p> For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br>
        gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that<br>
        you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the<br>
        source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their<br>
        rights.</p>
      <p> We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and<br>
        (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,<br>
        distribute and/or modify the software.</p>
      <p> Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain<br>
        that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free<br>
        software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we<br>
        want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so<br>
        that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original<br>
        authors' reputations.</p>
      <p> Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software<br>
        patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free<br>
        program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the<br>
        program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any<br>
        patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.</p>
      <p> The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
        modification follow.</p>
      <p> GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
        TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</p>
      <p> 0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains<br>
        a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed<br>
        under the terms of this General Public License. The &quot;Program&quot;, 
        below,<br>
        refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot;<br>
        means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:<br>
        that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,<br>
        either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another<br>
        language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in<br>
        the term &quot;modification&quot;.) Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</p>
      <p>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>
        covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of<br>
        running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program<br>
        is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the<br>
        Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).<br>
        Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.</p>
      <p> 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's<br>
        source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you<br>
        conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate<br>
        copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the<br>
        notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;<br>
        and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License<br>
        along with the Program.</p>
      <p>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and<br>
        you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.</p>
      <p> 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion<br>
        of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and<br>
        distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>
        above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p>
      <p> a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices<br>
        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</p>
      <p> b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in<br>
        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any<br>
        part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third<br>
        parties under the terms of this License.</p>
      <p> c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively<br>
        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such<br>
        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an<br>
        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a<br>
        notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide<br>
        a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under<br>
        these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this<br>
        License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but<br>
        does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on<br>
        the Program is not required to print an announcement.)</p>
      <p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If<br>
        identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,<br>
        and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>
        themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>
        sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you<br>
        distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>
        on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>
        this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>
        entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote 
        it.</p>
      <p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>
        your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>
        exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>
        collective works based on the Program.</p>
      <p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program<br>
        with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of<br>
        a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>
        the scope of this License.</p>
      <p> 3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,<br>
        under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of<br>
        Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:</p>
      <p> a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable<br>
        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections<br>
        1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</p>
      <p> b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three<br>
        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your<br>
        cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete<br>
        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be<br>
        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium<br>
        customarily used for software interchange; or,</p>
      <p> c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer<br>
        to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is<br>
        allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you<br>
        received the program in object code or executable form with such<br>
        an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)</p>
      <p>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>
        making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source<br>
        code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any<br>
        associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to<br>
        control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a<br>
        special exception, the source code distributed need not include<br>
        anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary<br>
        form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the<br>
        operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component<br>
        itself accompanies the executable.</p>
      <p>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering<br>
        access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent<br>
        access to copy the source code from the same place counts as<br>
        distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not<br>
        compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</p>
      <p> 4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program<br>
        except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt<br>
        otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is<br>
        void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.<br>
        However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under<br>
        this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such<br>
        parties remain in full compliance.</p>
      <p> 5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>
        signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>
        distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are<br>
        prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by<br>
        modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the<br>
        Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>
        all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>
        the Program or works based on it.</p>
      <p> 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the<br>
        Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>
        original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to<br>
        these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further<br>
        restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>
        You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to<br>
        this License.</p>
      <p> 7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>
        infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>
        conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
        otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
        excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot<br>
        distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
        License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>
        may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent<br>
        license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by<br>
        all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>
        the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>
        refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.</p>
      <p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under<br>
        any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to<br>
        apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other<br>
        circumstances.</p>
      <p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>
        patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>
        such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>
        integrity of the free software distribution system, which is<br>
        implemented by public license practices. Many people have made<br>
        generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>
        through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>
        system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>
        to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>
        impose that choice.</p>
      <p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>
        be a consequence of the rest of this License.</p>
      <p> 8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in<br>
        certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>
        original copyright holder who places the Program under this License<br>
        may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding<br>
        those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among<br>
        countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates<br>
        the limitation as if written in the body of this License.</p>
      <p> 9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<br>
        of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will<br>
        be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail 
        to<br>
        address new problems or concerns.</p>
      <p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program<br>
        specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any<br>
        later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions<br>
        either of that version or of any later version published by the Free<br>
        Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number 
        of<br>
        this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software<br>
        Foundation.</p>
      <p> 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free<br>
        programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author<br>
        to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free<br>
        Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes<br>
        make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals<br>
        of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software 
        and<br>
        of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.</p>
      <p> NO WARRANTY</p>
      <p> 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY<br>
        FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN<br>
        OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES<br>
        PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER 
        EXPRESSED<br>
        OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF<br>
        MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK 
        AS<br>
        TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE<br>
        PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,<br>
        REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p>
      <p> 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>
        WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR<br>
        REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,<br>
        INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING<br>
        OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED<br>
        TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED 
        BY<br>
        YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER<br>
        PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE<br>
        POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
      <p> END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>
